day 2 of not knowing what the fuck I am doing
i have the script( story ) of the game ready, but i have no idea how to implement it
I thought I should start with the level design, turns out- it's the worst fucking idea according to redditors since eve biting that apple
game mechanics it is then
also- I haven't setup a git, WHAT AM I DOING WITH THIS GAME, ON GOD


ok, i've added the git manually because the version control of godot just doesn't wanna work for some reason
haven't yet decided on the name of this game, maybe when it's done, also- probably gonna name the murderer séan or seán, i don't remember his name, pretty sure it;s seán
